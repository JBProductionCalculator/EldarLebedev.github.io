    <p style="font-weight: 400;">The Controller may process your personal data if it is necessary for you to use the Webpage (<a href="http://urbanidad.pl/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://urbanidad.pl&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1591558660870000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWD_kc7hvlaHwP5Q_p7sHl1KEkmQ">http://urbanidad.pl</a>).</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">Purposes of data processing which you indicate in the Contact Form are connected with:</p>
    <ul style="font-weight: 400;">
        <li>Ensuring the proper functioning of the Website, including filling in the Contact Form, which is a legitimate interest pursued by the Controller, - the basis for such processing shall be Article 6 Section 1 letter f GDPR;</li>
        <li>Communication with you in connection with your message sent through a Contact form, which is a legitimate interest pursued by the Controller, - the basis for such processing shall be Article 6 Section 1 letter f GDPR;</li>

        <li>Data portability;</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent for personal data processing to an extent in which the basis for processing your personal data is consent (withdrawing consent shall not affect compliance with the right process which was applied based on consent prior to its
            withdrawal);</li>
        <li>Raise an objection against processing your personal data to an extent in which the basis for the processing of your personal data is a premise of a Controller&rsquo;s legitimate interest;</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-weight: 400;">To exercise your rights, please contact the Controller.</p>

        by the use of such settings at any time so that it blocks cookies or warns you against saving cookies on the device used by you. In such a case it can happen that you will not have access to certain contents on the Webpage and, in extreme cases,
        the Webpage cannot display properly as access is blocked.</p>
